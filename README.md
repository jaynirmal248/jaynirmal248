# Hi there, I'm Jay Nirmal 👋

## About Me 🚀

Hi! I’m Jay, a WordPress developer, graphic designer, web/account manager, and photographer from India 🇮🇳. I blend technical expertise with creative flair to build websites, designs, and solutions that fit your needs—not your budget! 💻✨

🚀 What Drives Me?
I believe perfection shouldn’t cost a fortune. Whether you need a professional website, stunning graphics, or seamless account management, I deliver polished results at super affordable rates (yes, even starting at $10!). My focus? Making your project exactly what you envision, without the premium price tag. 💸

📸 Nature Through My Lens
When I’m not designing or coding, I’m out capturing the serenity of nature! My photography portfolio is entirely dedicated to earthy vibes—think forests, skies, and landscapes. But don’t worry—this passion stays in my personal gallery! For your projects, I adapt to your style, whether it’s modern, minimalist, bold, or anything in between. 🌄🌱
